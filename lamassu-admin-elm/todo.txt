v on page load, correctly set page and category

validation:

- base on json-schema validator (will need a port)
- each config screen has validation errors mapped to each field
- each errored field is red with error message
- if config screen has any errors, config name in navbar is red
- if any config groups have any errored configs, config group is red in nav bar
- same for accounts
- ribbon on top shows that config isn't complete
- besides individual json-schema compliance, also check that all chosen account are not in error
