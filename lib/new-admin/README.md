## Running

Differences from main lamassu-admin:

- `bin/new-lamassu-register <username>` to add a user
- `bin/new-lamassu-admin --dev` to run the server
- `bin/graphql-dev` to run the graphql dev environment

Note: Graphql already runs on the main server, but for cors reasons the graphql-dev is a unsecured server
